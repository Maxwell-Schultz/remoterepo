I learned how to make a remote repo and use a local git repo. We also covered the importance of a journal and that it is required 1 entry per week.

I learned the imporance of being respectful. I also learned that the 2 most imporant things were 1- Somone who understands and can communicate is vital. 2- Smart people who cna create software according to the requirements. BE RESPONSIBLE.
